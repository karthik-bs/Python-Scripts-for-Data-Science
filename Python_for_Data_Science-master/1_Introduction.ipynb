      "> Python is an easy to learn, powerful programming language. It has efficient high-level data structures and a simple but effective approach to object-oriented programming. Python\u2019s elegant syntax and dynamic typing, together with its interpreted nature, make it an ideal language for scripting and rapid application development in many areas on most platforms.\n",

      "\n",
      "> Very often programming is about shuffling data in and out of different tools, converting one data format to another, extracting numerical data from a text, and administering numerical experiments involving a large number of data files and directories.  Such tasks are much faster to accomplish in a language like Python than in Fortran, C, C++, C#, or Java\n",

      "> The practice of data science involves many interrelated but different activities, including accessing data, manipulating data, computing statistics about data, plotting/graphing/visualizing data, building predictive and explanatory models from data, evaluating those models on yet more data, integrating models into production systems, etc. One option for the data scientist is to learn several different software packages that each specialize in one or two of these things, but don\u2019t do them all well, plus learn a programming language to tie them together. (Or do a lot of manual work.)  \n",
      "> \n",
      "> An alternative is to use a general-purpose, high-level programming language that provides libraries to do all these things. Python is an excellent choice for this. It has a diverse range of open source libraries for just about everything the data scientist will do. It is available everywhere; high performance python interpreters exist for running your code on almost any operating system or architecture. Python and most of its libraries are both open source and free. Contrast this with common software packages that are available in a course via an academic license, yet are extremely expensive to license and use in industry.\n",

Python scripts - files containing definitions of functions and variables, and typically including code invoking some of those functions - can also be run from a command line. Using Python scripts from the command line may be the subject of a future primer. \n",
