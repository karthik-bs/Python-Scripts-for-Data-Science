      "> The field of Data Mining (or KDD: Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining) started as an offshoot of Machine Learning, and they remain closely linked. Both fields are concerned with the analysis of data to find useful or informative patterns.

Nevertheless, it is worth pointing out some of the differences to give perspective.\n",

It also is concerned with issues of agency and cognition \u2014 how will an intelligent agent use learned knowledge to reason and act in its environment \u2014 which are not concerns of Data Mining.\n",
      "> \n",
      ">Historically, KDD spun off from Machine Learning as a research field focused on concerns raised by examining real-world applications, and a decade and a half later the KDD community remains more concerned with applications than Machine Learning is. As such, research focused on commercial applications and business issues of data analysis tends to gravitate toward the KDD community rather than to Machine Learning. KDD also tends to be more concerned with the entire process of data analytics: data preparation, model learning, evaluation, and so on.\n"
